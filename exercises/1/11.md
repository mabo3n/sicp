**Exercise 1.11**: A function ƒ is defined by the rule that

ƒ(*n*) = { *n* if *n* < 3, 
           ƒ(*n* − 1) + 2ƒ(*n* − 2) + 3ƒ(*n* − 3) if *n* ≥ 3.

Write a procedure that computes ƒ by means of a recursive
process. Write a procedure that computes ƒ by means of an
iterative process.

Recursive:

```scheme
(define (foo n)
  (if (< n 3) 
      n
      (+ (foo (- n 1))
         (* 2 (foo (- n 2)))
         (* 3 (foo (- n 3))))))
```

Iterative:

```scheme
(define (foo n)
  (define (iter a b c counter)
    (if (= counter n)
        (+ a b c)
        (iter (+ a b c) (* 2 a) (* 3 (/ b 2)) (+ counter 1))))
  (if (< n 3) 
      n 
      (iter 2 2 0 3)))
```

```scheme
(foo 5)
(iter 2 2 0 3)
(iter (+ 2 2 0) (* 2 2) (* 3 (/ 2 2)) (+ 3 1))
(iter 4 4 3 4)
(iter (+ 4 4 3) (* 2 4) (* 3 (/ 4 2)) (+ 4 1)
(iter 11 8 6 5)
(+ 11 8 6)
(25)
```

I come up with this iterative procedure whose number of parameter scales with the number of references to the function itself in its definition. It seems that there must be a way to compute a "derivative" of ƒ that would allow the iteration with a static number of state variables, but I could't do that.
