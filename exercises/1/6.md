Context:

```scheme
(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) 
             x)) 
     0.001))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

**Exercise 1.6**: Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why if needs to
be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as
an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?” she asks. Alyssa’s
friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of if:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```scheme
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root
program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter-2 guess x) ; renamed from sqrt-iter to sqrt-iter-2
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute
square roots? Explain.

---

Using the applicative order evaluation the interpreter will evalute all 3 arguments of the *new-if* procedure, including the last one which should only be evaluated if the expression provided on the first argument is false. This will lead to a infinite loop since the the last argument is an expression
that calls the *sqrt-iter* procedure itself.

I think this could be resolved if the two last arguments were references to procedures as data, which would be evalutaed like so. I think in later lessons it will be taught a way to do so, and, of course, along with a way to "call" the procedures, prompting the interpreter to actually evaluate the expressions they represent.
