**Exercise 1.5**: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine
whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative
order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the
following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that
uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he
observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? 
Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for 
the special form if is the same whether the interpreter 
is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression 
is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to 
evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

---

If the interpreter is using applicative-order evaluation, the
execution will enter on an infinite loop and will return nothing at all. As in applicative-order evaluation the operands are evaluated first, before evaluating the body of the *test* procedure, the interpreter will try to evaluate both arguments, including *y*, which will lead to a infinite loop because of it is a procedure that calls itself (*p*).

Using normal-order evaluation, the expression carried by the parameter *y* would only be evaluated when needed. In the example, the procedure was called with *x* being 0, so the predicate of the *if* procedure inside the body of the *test* procedure will be evaluated to true, and 0 will be [successfully]
returned with *y* not even being evaluated.
